Fullstack Goodreads API Application

A simple and responsive book/author search that queries Goodreads public api.
+ Followed mobile first design principles to create a fully responsive UI.
+ Leveraged CSS Grid to implement responsive layout.
+ Rails API endpoint accepts query parameters and serves relevant Goodreads API response.
+ Leveraged jQuery to switch between CSS classes and listen for DOM events.

Note:
With this app I took the oppertunity to lean more heavily on CSS (as opposed to Javascript) to manipulate and style the elements on the DOM. Any notes or general feedback is welcomed as I would like to continue exploring CSS implementations and frontend best practices.
